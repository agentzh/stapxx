stap++ - Simple macro language extensions to systemtap

Synopsis
========

    $ stap++ -I ./tapset -x 12345 --arg limit=10 samples/ngx-upstream-post-conn.sxx
    $ stap++ -e 'probe begin { println("hello") exit() }'

Description
===========

This interpreter adds some simple macro language extensions to the systemtap scripting language.

Efforts has been made to ensure that this macro language expansion does
not affect the source line numbers so that the line numbers reported by `stap` are exactly the same in the original `.sxx` source files.

Features
========

Standard Macro Variables
------------------------

### $^exec_path

The variable `$^exec_path` is always evaluated to the path to the executable file
for the pid specified by the `-x` option.

Here is an example:

    probe process("$^exec_path").function("blah") { ... }

### $^libNAME_path

This variable expands to the absolute path of the DSO library file specified by a pattern.

`stap++` automatically scans all the loaded DSO files in the running process (if the `-x PID` option is specified) to find a match. If it fails to find a match, this variable will take the value of `$^exec_path`, that is, assuming the library is statically linked.

Below is an example for tracing a user-land function in the libpcre library:

    probe process("$^libpcre_path").statement("pcre_exec")
    {
        println("pcre_exec called")
        print_ubacktrace()
    }

### $^arg_NAME

This variable can evaluate to the value of a specified command-line argument. For example, `$^arg_limit` is evaluated to the value of the command line argument `limit` specified like this:

    stap++ --arg limit=1000

### Default values

It's possible to specify a default value for a macro variable by means of the `default` trait, as in

    foreach (key in stats- limit $^arg_limit :default(1000)) {
        ...
    }

where `$^arg_limit` takes the default value 1000 when the user does not specify the `--arg limit=N` command-line option while invoking `stap++`.

User-defined Macro Variables
----------------------------

It's possible to bind a `@cast()` expression to a user-defined builtin variable of the form `$*NAME`. Here is an example,

    sock = sockfd_lookup(fd)
    $*sock := @cast(sock, "socket", "kernel")

    printf(", sock->state:%d", $*sock->state)
    state = $*sock->sk->__sk_common->skc_state
    printf(", sock->sk->sk_state:%d (%s)\n", state, tcp_sockstate_str(state))

Note that we used the `:=` operator to bind a `@cast()` expression to user variable `$*sock`, and later we reference it whenever we need that `@cast()` expression.

The scope of user variables is always limited to the current `.sxx` source file.

Tapset Modules
--------------

One can use the stap++ language to define new tapset module files and later use the `@use` directive to load the module in a main stap++ program file.

For example, we can have a module file located at `./tapset/kernel/socket.sxx`:

    // module kernel.socket
    function socketfd_lookup(fd)
    {
        ...
    }

And then in a stap++ script file, `foo.sxx`, we can import this library like this

    @use kernel.socket

and in `foo.sxx`, we are now free to call the `socketfd_lookup` function defined in the `kernel.socket` module.

Finally, we should invoke the `stap++` interpreter like this:

    stap++ -I ./tapset foo.sxx ...

Note the `-I ./tapset` option that specifies the search path for the stap++ tapset modules. The default module search paths are `.`, and `<bin-dir>/tapset`, where `<bin-dir>` is the directory where `stap++` sits in.

Unlike `stap`, only the used stapset modules are processed so as to reduce startup time.

One can `@use` multiple modules like this

    @use kernel.socket
    @use nginx.upstream

All those macro variables are free to use in the tapset module files.
